      <p> So this is where ton's of awesome documentation is supposed to go. However, I don't know anything about JS at the time of writing this so I am going to just type in stuff and see where it goes!.</p>
      <p> We are supposed to have quite a bot of <code>p</code> elements in our documents so here is one to start XD.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="What_you_should_already_know">
    <header> What you should already know</header>
    <article>
      <p> Again I don't even know what you are supposed to know in order to successfully learn JS or Java as a whole. However I am sure we can guess yea?
        <ul>
          <li> Java</li>
          <li>Front End Dev</li>
          <li>Fast Typing Skills?</li>
          <li>Devops stuff?</li>
          <li> A cat(this must be true I saw it on facebook)</li>
      </ul>
      I am sure those are just a few things and I am sure there are ton's more!</p>
    <p> However I can say that I know a little bit of C++.
      <code> Void Main (i++,stuff,stuff)
        {
        insert more stuff here;
        }
      </code>
      See that rocked XD</code>
  </p>

<section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
  <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
  <article>
    <p> So here we are again more JS and Java. I don't know why they keep asking me because, honestly like I said before I don't know this very well. I guess that I could you know try a little bit.
      <code> function greetMe(yourName) {
  alert("Hello " + yourName);
}
greetMe("World");
      </code>
      So above it does stuff like calling a function called greetMe and then getting a variable called yourName and then printing it out to console. so I guess that is pretty cool yeah?</p>

<section class="main-section" id="More_know">
  <header>More know</header>
  <p> So here we are about 4th one in. I mean at this point it's quite crazy and we have very little things in our technical documentation. I mean heck I almost forgot to save all of this hard work I am doing. That could have been bad like really bad. Let's get another code block in this bad boy:</p>
    <code> 
if (condition) {
  statement_1;
} else {
  statement_2;
}
    </code>
    <p> So here we are again more Java stuff. It looks like we are doing if statments. Like if we do this then do that else do something completly different. It's quite crazy stuff to be frank!</p>
  </article>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="The_End">
  <header>The End</header>
  <article>
    <p> So we should be at the end really really soon. We forgot to else if statements:</p>
    <code> If (do stuff){
      else (stuff){
      do more stuff
      }
      elseif(odd){
      Do more stuff!
      }
      }
    </code>
    <p> Like seriously we have so much stuff we have to do in order to do more stuff it's cray cray!</p>
    <p> If you want your brain to explode look at this:</p>
    <code>
      var n = 0;
var x = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  n++;
  x += n;
}
             </code>
      <p> Like I said before your brain is going to explode. I mean we set n to 0 and then say that while n less than 3 incrament 2 and well to be frank n = 0. Maybe hahahahahaha</p>
